# Map Files

This directory contains map files in both `OpenDRIVE` and `CommonRoad` formats and the converter script.

## OpenDRIVE Format

The `OpenDRIVE` format is used by the CARLA simulation environment.

## CommonRoad Format

The `CommonRoad` format is used by the CommonRoad Scenario Designer. These files are used to draw detailed maps using the [draw_map.sh](../data_analysis/visualisation/map_drawing/draw_map.sh) script.

## Conversion

The `xml_converter.py` script is used to convert map files from the `OpenDRIVE` format to the `CommonRoad` format.
