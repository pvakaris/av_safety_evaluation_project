\chapter{Source Code}

The source code PDF was generated using an open-source tool called code2pdf developed by Lucas Caton \cite{code2pdf}. The data files and the CommonRoad Scenario Designer module were omitted. However, they can be found in the source code zip. The whole project is also stored on GitHub. It can be accessed using the following URL: \url{https://github.com/pvakaris/av\_safety\_evaluation\_project}. The repository is left private to avoid plagiarism and other misuses. The code used in the video demonstration was written before April 6, 2023.
